fretboardchamp
==============

An old simple tool I built for myself to practice the positioning of each note on the guitar fretboard.
It simply cycles through each note of the musical scale randomly and prompts me to find it on the fretboard whicher string I want to practice on. I originally built this to practice where the notes are whenever I tuned my guitar in an alternative tuning.
